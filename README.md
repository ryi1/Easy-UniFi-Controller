## Deploying a UniFi controller in a super easy way

To run this script you just have to do the following as an administrator user or user with docker permissions

### run the next line

#### First we give execution permissions to the script with the command

```bash
./easy-unifi-controller.sh
```
#### OR

```bash
bash easy-unifi-controller.sh

```
#### Here it will show how to access the UniFi Controller
